Operators:

Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can compare things
if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.


There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:

We use arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations, Like additions, subtractions etc,

+=> Addition
-=> Subtraction
/=> Division
*=> Multiplication
% => modulus , remainder

Relational operators:

Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger than other thing or
if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.

==      => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
!=      => used to check if two variables don`t contain the same value. we get a true if they are not the same>  y  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true.
<       => used to check of the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a true

>=      => if the value on the left is greater than the value on right side or of they are same we will get a true
<=      => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other than thing.


Conditional constructs:

Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true that java executes the
code otherwise it skips the code.

How to write IfElse conditions:

if (condition){

any line of code even another if conditions

}

if(){

}

Important Notes:

1)for String we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive sata type
2)We can cmd+opt+l (Mac)  ctrl+alt+l (windows) to format our code.
3)If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check to to other part.


if else conditions

    When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions i should use if else if conditions
    Whem we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other use Nested if conditions.
